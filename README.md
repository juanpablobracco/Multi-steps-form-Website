Form client side validation => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation

- Builtin form validation:
  
  - required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
  - minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings).
  - min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types.
  - type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.
  - pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.


Website security =>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security

- Warning: Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request.
